# PowerpointGPT

a quick & fun little project making a parody kinda version of ChatGPT in Powerpoint 
(It's not meant to be a scalable & serious thing)


## Why?

I just felt like giving it a shot and ended up using VBA macros to call OpenAI API, nothing fancy, just a simple concept with a straightforward UI

## Features ðŸ’›

- Use your own OpenAI API key
- Get ChatGPT responses inside Powerpoint
- Save conversations 





## Limitations ðŸš§

- Breaks on long responses 
- Only one prompt & response at a time
- Doesn't remember previous conversation

## Instructions

- Download the .ppsm file from this [link](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1019828050629767249/1073276464482492456/PowerpointGPT.ppsm) or download from the repo's files
- Simply open the file :)
- Font "Noto Sans" might be needed to look properly
- You need to "Enable Content" (ActiveX) so the macros works.
- For transparency the VBA macro is [here](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1019828050629767249/1073277608395018300/Slide2.cls) or from the repo's file
